# NLP_Yelp-reviews_Project
NLP Project using Yelp review data set from Kaggle. 
I am exploring the data using visualizations. 
I'll create a Data frame with only 2 reviews.
 I'll use a pipeline using count vector, TF-ID, and MultinomiaNB to predict and evaluate the data 
From the findings, I can see that TF-ID made things worse 
The pipeline with just Count Vector and Naive Bayes is more accurate
